# Simple_Programs
Simple Python Stuff
Hey Ben, this is a README file. This is a file normally in all github repositories. 
It basically just gives an overview of what you are doing in said repository.
In this repository we can just upload various simple python programs and also work on things together!
As you can see I already uploaded a python file I had made onto the repository. I also edited it and did a "commit"
A commit is essentially saving the code and you can also document what you did before that save.
In my commit, I added comments to my python email script. Now when you look at commits, you can see my comment about adding comments. 
This is a very good coding practice that you should do all the time so you don't lose code. It is also for reverting to an older commit
in case you really screw up your code and want to go back. 

Well I think thats all for now!
